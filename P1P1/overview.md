### Functions I can Use:
- `len()`
- `sorted()`
- `print()`

### `.py` Files:
- 1_mean.py
- 2_median.py
- 3_filter.py
- 4_stddev.py


### RegEx Tips:
- `1_mean.py`
  - check to see that the initial `sum` value is equal to 0 (checks were still passing even if it wasn't)
- `2_median.py`
  - `if length % 2 == 0` works, but `if length%2==0` does not.
- `3_filter.py`
  - all good!
- `4_stddev.py`
  - when checking for exponentiation, should the RegEx check for a specific exponent? Currently it is just checking for \*\* (two `*`'s)
